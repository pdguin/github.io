            <div class="faq">
                <h2>1. What is a health insurance premium</h2>
                <p>Well, you see, the premium is the amount you pay to the insurance company every month to maintain your coverage. It's like a subscription fee. You pay this every month, regardless of whether you use medical services or not.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <h2>2. What is a deductible?</h2>
                <p>Now, the deductible is the amount you need to pay out-of-pocket for medical expenses before your health insurance plan begins to pay. Let's say you have a $1,000 deductible. That means you'll pay 100% of your medical expenses until the bills total $1,000. After that, your insurance starts to cover a portion of your costs.</p>

            <div class="faq">
                <h2>3. What does 'out-of-pocket maximum' mean?</h2>
                <p>So, the out-of-pocket maximum is the most you have to pay for covered services in a year. After you reach this amount, your health insurance will pay 100% of the allowed amount for your covered healthcare expenses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <h2>4. What is the difference between in-network and out-of-network providers?</h2>
                <p>In-network providers are those doctors or hospitals with which your health insurance company has an agreement to provide services for less. Out-of-network providers are those providers with which your insurance company does not have a contract. You'll usually pay more to see an out-of-network provider.</p>

            <div class="faq">
                <h2>5. How can I choose the best health insurance plan for me?</h2>
                <p>Choosing a plan that's right for you involves considering several factors like your budget, your health condition, and your individual healthcare needs. You also need to understand terms like premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums. It's not an easy task, but our 'Insurance Plan Comparisons' page could be a good starting point for you.</p>

            <div class="faq">
                <h2>6. What is co-insurance?</h2>
                <p>Co-insurance is your share of the costs of a healthcare service. It's usually a percentage of the amount your insurance approves, and you start paying co-insurance after you've met your deductible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <h2>7. What does 'pre-existing condition' mean?</h2>
                <p>A 'pre-existing condition' is a health problem that existed before the date your health insurance coverage starts. Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies can't refuse to cover you or charge you more just because you have a pre-existing condition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <h2>8. What are the benefits of preventive services?</h2>
                <p>Preventive services, like vaccines and screenings, are crucial because they can help prevent illnesses before they start or catch health conditions early when they are easier to treat. Plus, under the Affordable Care Act, a range of preventive services are covered for free.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <h2>9. Can I buy health insurance at any time of the year?</h2>
                <p>Typically, you can only buy health insurance during the Open Enrollment Period or during a Special Enrollment Period if you qualify. The Open Enrollment Period usually happens once a year.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <h2>10. What is a health insurance marketplace?</h2>
                <p>The health insurance marketplace, also known as the exchange, is a service available in every state that helps individuals, families, and small businesses shop for and enroll in affordable health insurance.</p>
