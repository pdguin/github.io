2. My Github account serves as a repository for my CTI-110 course project, which will be home to my "Navigating Health Insurance" website.
3. The repository I created was completed using the steps provided by my Professor.  I am unfamiliar with Github aside from a few happenstance instances, but I look forward to becoming more familiar.
4. In order to clone my repository, I transferred the files within my Portfolio Project into the local repository folder that I created after downloading and installing the Github desktop application.  Once all the files had transferred, I clicked on "Push origin" (Publish) in order to upload the local repository into the Github.com repository.
