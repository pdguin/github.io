        <h2>Common Insurance Terms</h2>
        <div class="column-container">
            <div class="column">
                <h3>Deductible</h3>
                <p>Your Deductible is what you will need to pay prior to your insurance providing coverage, for any covered items. In some cases, you will have coverage prior to this, such as for preventative medicine.</p>

                <h3>Co-payment</h3>
                <p>This term refers to what you will pay for a specific type of healthcare provider, each visit.  This is usually defined within your insurance information so you know what to expect when you visit a provider.</p>

                <h3>Premium</h3>
                <p>This is your monthly cost for healthcare coverage.  This does not apply to your deductible OR Out-of-Pocket maximum (OOP max), therefore do not include this when evaluating your plan as it pertains to your .</p>

                <h3>Out-of-pocket (OOP) Maximum</h3>
                <p>This is the most that you should expect to pay for healthcare services for any covered services, WITHIN your plan.  Once you have paid whatever this amount is in a year, all other covered services are covered 100%!</p>

                <h3>Network</h3>
                <p>This means the healthcare providers that your insurance company has agreed to work with.  This is especially important, as most plans provide little to no coverage if you visit a provider that is out of network.</p>

                <h3>Co-insurance</h3>
                <p>This is usually associated with a specific type of covered health service and refers to the amount that you will have to pay out of pocket AFTER you've paid your deductible. For example, if you need to see a chiropractor and this is covered by your plan with co-insurance of 50%, once you have paid your deductible, you will owe 50% of the chiropractor's charges and your insurance will cover the other 50%.</p>

                <h3>Provider</h3>
                <p>This term simply refers to the healthcare provider or outfit that provided you with healthcare services.  This could be the name of your doctor or the name of the hospital or facility.</p>

                <h3>Exclusion</h3>
                <p>This term refers to a specific situation or concern for which your insurance will not provide coverage. This could be a pre-existing condition or simply a medical procedure that your provider has opted not to provide coverage for.</p>

                <h3>Grace Period</h3>
                <p>This refers to the amount of time that you will have AFTER missing a premium payment before your coverage is cancelled.  In the event that you miss a payment, you should always contact your provider and discuss the situation with them, in advance if possible.</p>

                <h3>Medically Necessary</h3>
                <p>This is a turn of phrase that is used to indicate whether a procedure or coverage should be covered by insurance, as a result of the provider's adjudication.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h3>Pre-existing Condition</h3>
                <p>This is an illness or condition that you had prior to obtaining health insurance coverage.</p>

                <h3>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)</h3>
                <p>This is a specific type of healthcare plan in which the insurance company has identified a number of providers that operate within their network and are available for their subscribers to visit for treatment.</p>

                <h3>Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)</h3>
                <p>This is a different type of network structure in which you have a much more limited number of providers that can provide you with in-network coverage, in an effort to reduce overall costs.</p>

                <h3>Enrollment Period</h3>
                <p>If you have selected coverage from the Healthcare.org Marketplace, you'll be familiar with this.  Effectively, this is a defined period of time in which you can sign up for or modify your healthcare insurance coverage or plan.</p>

                <h3>Grievance</h3>
                <p>A grievance is a complaint as it pertains to your coverage or service received from your healthcare insurance provider or a healthcare provider.</p>

                <h3>Reimbursement</h3>
                <p>In some cases, you may pay for medical services directly out of your own pocket.  If the service(s) are covered by your health insurance plan, you can request to be paid back or reimbursed for that expense.</p>

                <h3>Urgent Care</h3>
                <p>Urgent Care, also colloquially referred to as a "Doc-in-a-Box," is when you need immediate urgent healthcare services but not so life-threatening or serious that you would visit the emergency room. The increase in the number of urgent care locations has grown to the point that many individuals now cite their urgent care provider as their primary physician.</p>

                <h3>Claim</h3>
                <p>This is when you or your doctor submit a request for payment for services that you received.</p>

                <h3>Referral</h3>
                <p>This is a written order from your primary physician to see a specialist or get certain medical services that are beyond the scope or comfort level of your primary care physician.  An example might be that your primary provider refers you to a dermatologist for a skin-related condition or concern.</p>

                <h3>Coverage Area</h3>
                <p>Your coverage area is the geographical area in which your health care provider provides health care coverage.  If you have relocated and had to enroll in new health insurance, you may have noticed that the providers available to you in your new location are different than those from your former location.</p>
                
                <h3>Formulary</h3>
                <p>A formulary is a medical jargon term for the list of prescription medications for which your insurance will provide coverage.  If your drugs are NOT on the list, verify whether you have coverage BEFORE you fill that prescription!</p>
